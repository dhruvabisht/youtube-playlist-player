# YouTube Playlist Player

This project allows you to create a website that plays YouTube videos from a specified playlist. Users can enter a YouTube playlist link, and the website will display and play the videos from that playlist.

## Steps to Deploy the Website

1. **Obtain the YouTube Data API Key**: Follow these steps to get an API key for the YouTube Data API:
   - Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing project.
   - Enable the YouTube Data API for your project.
   - Generate an API key.

2. **Set Up a Backend Server**: Choose a server-side programming language like Node.js, Python, or PHP to create a backend server. Here, we'll use Node.js as an example:
   - Install Node.js if you haven't already.
   - Create a new directory for your project.
   - Create a `server.js` file and copy the backend code provided in this project.

3. **Install Dependencies**: In the root directory of your project, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

4. **Update the Backend Code**: Replace the placeholder `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in the `server.js` file with the API key obtained in Step 1.

5. **Create the Frontend HTML File**: Create a new HTML file named `home.html` and copy the frontend code provided in this project.

6. **Customize the Frontend**: Modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in `home.html` to suit your design preferences. Feel free to update the styling, layout, and UI elements as desired.

7. **Connect the Frontend and Backend**: In `home.html`, update the API endpoint URL in the JavaScript code to match the backend server URL where you'll be running the server.

8. **Deploy the Website**: You can deploy the website using GitHub Pages by following these steps:
- Create a new repository on GitHub.
- Push the `home.html` and `server.js` files to the repository.
- Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings, using the `master` branch as the source.
- Access your deployed website at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository_name>`.

9. **Add Screenshots of the Final Website**:
